                    <p class="text" id="text">Music is regarded as one of the triumphs of human creativity. But does music itself help one to create?

                        It’s a question worth asking, since music has increasingly become a part of the modern-day workplace. Music has a strange temporal permanence; as art decorates space, so does music decorate time.
                        
                        With so much of our time being spent at work, and so much of our work being done at computers, music has become inseparable from our day-to-day tasks—a way to “optimize the boring” while looking at screens.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>01 Music makes repetitive tasks more enjoyable</strong> <br>
                        Music’s effectiveness is dependent on how “immersive” a task is, referring to the creative demand of the work. When a task is clearly defined and repetitive in nature, research suggests that music is consistently helpful.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>02 In a noisy workplace, music is an escape.</strong><br>
                        While the open-office debate rages on, one point has become clear: a noisy workplace can halt personal productivity in its tracks. Perhaps a pair of headphones may not be as distracting as some companies think.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>03 Ambient noise is the creative sweet spot.</strong><br>
                        For those who do enjoy listening to music during creative sessions, an atmospheric presence seems to work best. Researchers have shown that a moderate noise level can get creative juices flowing, but the line is easily crossed; loud noises made it incredibly difficult to concentrate.</p>
